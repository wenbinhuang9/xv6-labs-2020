1. a1, a2 to a7 holds function parameters 

2. no calling , just use inline function, computed directly by li a1, 12

3. the address is in 0000000000000630

4. The next instruction of main : 0x38

5. The ouput is HE110 World, 
    r: 72, l: 6C, d: 64
    rld = 726C64

    if it is big-endian, set i to 0x00726c64
    we don't need to x, no matter it is big-endian or little-endian 

6. depends on the value on param register
